# Media Directory

The `media` directory is used to store supporting files for the application. Things like requirement documentation, text outlines, etc. This is the junk drawer for the project.

This directory is part of the structure which `angular-folder-structure`
recommends. For more information about this directory see the
[documentation](https://angular-folder-structure.readthedocs.io/en/latest/media.html).
